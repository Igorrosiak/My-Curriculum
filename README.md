This project was created in 2022.

It consists of a Web Page for my personal curriculum.

This application uses: React, React-Bootstrap, SASS, Styled-Components and React-Router-DOM

You can use it running "npm install" in the main path terminal AND running "npm start" after installing all dependencies.
